# ADLHeroAPIAbuser
This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) script to demonstrate how an API can be abused to manipulate in-game rewards in the ADLHero game. The script utilizes multi-threading to send a high volume of crafted API requests, potentially bypassing game mechanics to gain excessive gold, experience, and items.
